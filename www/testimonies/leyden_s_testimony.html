    <p class="alert alert-primary">Note: I typed this testimony as I heard it from a video, so forgive me for any incorrect spellings I might have done.</p>

    <p>My name is Christian Leyden, am a man of God and servant of Christ, this is who I am, and this is what I do. Am so thankful
      to be able to have this opportunity, and this is my story.</p>

    <p>Growing up I didn’t have my father around, and I grew up as a kid, we moved around every year so I was always the new
      kid, I was always searching for acceptance. My mom she struggled, she was working two jobs to raise me and my brother
      up. Some of the earliest memories I found, when I was in third grade, I remember writing my mom letters, suicide note
      letters, and telling her that I didn’t want to live anymore, telling her that I didn’t feel good enough. I started
      fighting a lot, I got really angry at a lot of people. So there was a lot of damage that was there in not having my
      father and things like that.</p>

    <p>And so after three years of that, and going through a lot of depression and sadness, and I started listening to metal
      music, heavy rock, hip-hop music, rap music, death metal, and all this music that was starting to get this strong
      <i>pulls</i> in my life. I started to get these different mindsets, they started to creep in, started to
      <i>root</i> into me about partying, doing drugs, and
      <i>getting</i> women and living this sort of lifestyle. And I was tired of not having friends, I was tired of not being
      a part of anything in this world, so I finally went to a football game, the only football game I ever been during high
      school, and I’d seen some of brother’s old friends, so they asked if I wanted to hang out and smoke weed with them,
      and just because they wanted to hang out with me I was like “yeah man I want to hang out with you”.</p>


    <p>There’s somebody who wants to talk with me, there’s someone who wants me to hang out with them, that wants to be around,
      <i>there’s a</i> reason why people wanted to hang out, and that was drugs and alcohol. It was more important to be accepted
      and things like that, so I would accept anything that came along with that.</p>

    <p>Three months into me drinking, smoking, I ended up in a psych ward for telling my family about me cutting myself, that
      I did for years. I just went through all different kinds of different stages in my life trying to be somebody am not.
      I mean it’s just been eight years of different institutions, drinking,
      <i>AA</i>, meth, CA, heroine, rehabs, Xanax…different kinds of pills, psych wards, partying, CMA, all sorts of institutions.
      I knew how destructive it was for me, but I just couldn’t stop, it was just all bad.</p>

    <p>I finally got locked, and it was the best thing that could ever happen to me, being locked up God humbled me, he put
      me in the belly of the fish, he got me locked up, no way to get out, no bail. I knew I needed God in a radical way,
      I needed Jesus to save me from self. Things have gotten a lot worse than they have ever been, so I know in my heart
      that I needed God in a mighty way.</p>

    <p>I grew up in church, people telling me “Jesus says this” and “the Bible says that”, and I just got so annoyed inside
      of my
      <i>filth</i>, and I was like “man I don’t care what anybody says, am tired of hearing about this Jesus dude “, for the
      first time in my life I desired to pick up a Bible and read it for myself, and I started reading from Matthew, and
      I knew that it was my only hope because I had tried everything else. I called upon Him, started reading the word, and
      the Holy Spirit started to show me all these different things, and show me how He was real, I started doing prayer
      groups and Bible studies, and just helping people, and it was prime place to just be in ministry, it was amazing, that
      even the pastor in there, he had me preach two Sundays instead of him, so I got the preaching stripes, which was amazing,
      a lot of people that never would have gone to church went to church.</p>

    <p>And God’s really showed me without
      <i>Him am nothing</i>, and am so glad He showed me that, and I always remember that. God is just doing mighty things,
      and He’s just been so amazing in my life, and His love has transformed my life, has changed my life, and it leaves
      me with no other choice but to serve Him every day, and am just so glad to be a son of God, that we do have a real
      Father that’s out there, that has the power to help us, to back out His love, His love isn’t just some desire that
      has no action toward it. He has action for it every day, and its fresh today, and His love is just amazing, He is amazing,
      He is worthy to be praised and sought after every day, and His plans that He has for those who love Him are just amazing.</p>

    <p>My life had
      <i>an</i> appearance of a dead situation, nobody else could help me, and I believe God waits for that moment because He
      wants you to know that He is the one that will be there always, He will be there to help when nobody else could help,
      and He loves you, and He just wants to be with you, and to converse with you and just have a conversation. He will
      meet you right where you at, just how His mercy, and His grace, and His love met me right where I was at, when I had
      nothing to offer but me, He didn’t ask for any other thing, He just asked for us, and He’ll never ask you for something
      you can’t give, and He’ll never
      <i>ask</i> you to do something you can’t do.</p>

    <p>And His plans for you are fresh every day, His love for you is fresh every day, His grace to empower you to do that which
      you
      <i>were never</i> able to do is fresh for you every day, and it’s just amazing when you just live this and stay active
      and do it, and abide in His word, and have you, and your life, and your will, just mingle with the word of God and
      Jesus and it’s amazing how beautiful your life
      <i>will be</i>.</p>

    <p>God bless you and let’s just live for Jesus</p>
