    <p>So before I became born again, I was a so called “pretender Christian” because I didn’t really know what a true Christian
      is like, I thought that going to church every Sunday is important and that when I am happy God is happy. I also thought
      sinning is cool because I thought that was what Lord Jesus came here to do. I thought going to church every Sunday
      was cool and that my sins will be forgiven without asking for myself to Lord Jesus, I would literally go to clubs and
      do my things there then make sure that Sunday I am going to church to ask for forgiveness then after, I would do the
      same thing over and over again. It was like I was using God, which is impossible to do. So as you can see I didn’t
      repent at all.</p>

    <p>I used to be a player I would go around playing with people’s feelings and use them for my pleasure, again I loved bragging
      about how many girls I had, but to be honest I was possessed by a demon or demons, I also once had a sugar mama(Older
      girlfriend). Those demons or this demon loved girls, weed, cars, cartoons, artists, animation and many other things.
      I once dated this girl then I slept with her after two weeks I slept with her cousin without her knowing, I and her
      cousin kept it our secret. I used to love artists like they were my gods I remember going to this event were well known
      artists were there, I remember seeing Caspper (A South African rapper) performing and from there I idolized him, I
      remember worshiping him in a way I wasn’t aware of so guys be careful who you admire, I only admire God and His Son
      Lord Jesus they are the ones worthy of worship guys. I used to lust over girls like very crazy, I would undress them
      and you know what I would do.</p>

    <p>This is a summary of my testimony of becoming a child of God as well as how I met Lord Jesus and my Father, God who created
      Heaven and Earth, my Dad who is loving, kind, peaceful, God over kings, eternal, wise, holy, best, better than the
      rest, forgiving, provisional, healing, protective, life giving, and much more than one could fully understand.</p>


    <p>Lord Jesus who is my teacher, leader, and brother, the One who my Father gave for us so that we may see our Father's
      kingdom and never perish, and He (Lord Jesus) is like my Father who is in heaven.</p>

    <p>So I used to date this girl and we dated for about 3 years we met via social media through a friend, me and this girl
      (my ex) didn’t have time to see each other, and she wasn't the problem, I wasn’t willing enough to meet her, she would
      set a date and I would always postpone with excuses and the thing is that it was a long distance relationship. I and
      Thami (name protected) the friend of my ex we used to be so close that we were like boyfriend and girlfriend and we
      liked being together I remember we were talking about kids and all that. Then this other day Thami asked me “can you
      be my virgin breaker?”, “yeah sure” said I, then we set the date for the initiation but somehow something always kept
      me busy so I couldn’t go to her place so that we can initiate, my ex knew nothing, that her best friend and her boyfriend
      wanted to sleep with each other. Then somehow I and Thami didn’t get along as before I didn't know why, if it was because
      I couldn’t make it or what but we did talk to each other.</p>

    <p>After two years of talking via social media finally I and my ex set a date to meet each other for the first time we met
      it was fun I enjoyed it. Cole (protected name of my friend) knew my ex he spoke via social media with my ex, then this
      other day Cole came to my home to tell me about my ex calling him almost every day when he is at school to meet up
      with him, then I asked myself “how is it possible that my girl calls my bro the way she used to call me before?”. Then
      the other day I had a dream where my ex betrayed me with Cole, well I was confused with the dream because I knew something
      was up between them. Then this one day I knew that only God can help me figure my life and who is right for me and
      not, then I remember asking God to show me what is going on with Cole and my ex and so that He may show me the light
      and the right path, and my Father showed what I wanted to see and not to trust anyone but Him, I remember waking up
      with tears on my eyes praising God and thanking Him on what He showed me and I remained faithful to Him until this
      day I pray that He keeps me faithful to Him forever and ever more.</p>


    <p>Then few weeks later I remember asking my ex to meet up with me because I wanted to confess to her all I have done her
      wrong behind her back, and I hoped that after I confessed she would tell me about her and Cole. I remember the day
      we met before praying to God that He may guide me and speak before me and help me. Then we met I told her everything
      I did, the cheating and trying to sleep with Thami without her knowing, and I remember telling her not to trust no
      one in this world, I remember her asking me why am I so ‘reddish’ I told her that it is hard to confess and it is my
      first time doing this then I asked her if she wanted to tell me anything she said no. Then when I was in a taxi going
      home I remember getting her text telling me that Cole and her were flirting and that she used to call him because they
      both had Telkom sim cards, I know you’re thinking that isn't an excuse well it matters not. She told me that she thanks
      the lord for my confession.</p>


    <p>I remember telling her that now I want to focus on God and that I can’t date her anymore and that I can’t give her attention
      she wants, and that she shouldn’t wait for me because I didn’t want her to think that I will come for her after focusing
      on God and I told her that I am not ready for relationship and that God will make me ready. I remember telling her
      that I am sorry for wasting time because I did, I remember telling her that I’m not leaving but I want to be close
      to God, and what I meant is that I didn’t want us to be strangers but friends. I remember telling her that we both
      don’t need each other, pastors, our parents or anything but God. I told her to rejoice for me because I am saved and
      not sad and that I’m leaving worldly stuff for Lord Jesus and God, she said she is happy for me. This is my summary
      testimony I didn’t include other stuffs, now I no longer just believe in God I know my Father and His son and I love
      them with all my heart guys, wow I truly do, my Father has been so good to me and showing me things I need to know
      about Him and the world and how corrupt it is, I live under his will not my will because I know and believe He knows
      better.
    </p>

    <p>Now I no longer worry about what I will eat, wear, be and impressing because we all know that we usually live to impress
      people rather than our Father. I pray to God that He may show you all the truth and lead you to the light before it’s
      too late for you all. He has shown me true love and that no one can give that much love to me and I feel it everyday
      guys! wow I am in love with God guys that is why I don’t want to go back to my old ways I pray that He keeps me in
      His hands forever. He gave us His only begotten Son so that whoever believes in Him shall have eternal life wow guys
      this is the love of God for us, wow! Brothers and sisters I pray that this testimony helps and encourages you all to
      know that our Father who reigns in heaven is alive and He is searching for hypocrites and sinners like me and you,
      we are lost dirty sheep and He is searching for us to bring us home and cleanse us! Don’t clean yourself let Him do
      it for you with love, besides even if you tried, you wouldn’t be able to do it. May peace of my Father and His Son
      be upon you all guys</p>
