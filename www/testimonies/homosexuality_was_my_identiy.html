    <p>When I was in elementary school I started to realize that I was becoming attracted to the same sex, and I was like “wait
      this is odd, and no one else is feeling this way, and no one else can know about this”.</p>

    <p>When I was a junior in high school, me and my best friend we came out to each other, so then I suddenly had this friend
      whom I could tell everything to, and tell him what I was feeling, and what it was like. And we started going out, we
      started going to gay bars, and clubs. Even in high school I still felt that being gay was not something that I was
      going to be for the rest of my life, I just thought “Oh well eventually I will get married, and have kids, and this
      will kind of get away”. But it didn’t go away.</p>

    <p>When I went to college, I was feeling more and more that homosexuality was becoming my core identity. I just knew that
      Christianity was never an option for me, ever, I just thought “am a gay man, like I can’t ever be a Christian, never
      the twain shall meet”, and so I just put God even further on the back burner, and didn’t even think of God at all.</p>

    <p>And then after college I moved to LA and I got in with a group of friends who were all like-minded, we lived our lives
      always kind of just wanting two things, and it was success in career and to find true love. I think I had a total of
      five serious relationships, and they were all very intense, and very real. Every time I was in one of these relationships
      it was like “okay, this is the one, this is the guy who is going to give me meaning in my life, this the person who
      is going to save me”, like I seriously saw them as almost like a “Messiah”, like this person will give my life meaning,
      I’ll have a reason to live. And I put so much pressure on these relationships.</p>

    <p>And so during all this time in Hollywood I did everything, I went to all the premiers, I went to Oscars, the Emmies,
      the Grammies, and I went to the governors ball after the Oscars. I was at one of the after parties one night, and like
      everyone was dancing and all the people of the fashion world were there and it was like very glamourous. And I just
      remember, just looking out over the sea of people all having the times of their lives, and I just felt so empty and
      dead inside, I felt so alone and just empty.</p>

    <p>And about six months later, I was at a coffee shop in Silverlake, and we noticed something very shocking, the table next
      to us had just Bibles over it. And we were kind of fascinated by it, even though to us it was like the enemy, like
      those are the people who hate who we are. So my friend urged me to talk to them, and I said “well what does your church
      believe about homosexuality?”, and he said “well you know it’s a sin”. And like I just stayed and then we talked some
      more and he invited me to his church.</p>

    <p>Somehow I got up the Sunday morning, and the preacher comes out, and he started preaching from Romans chapter seven,
      and all the sudden the Holy Spirit just flooded me, that’s when I saw the Holiness of God and my sinfulness at the
      same time. And I just started bawling, it was like this mix of joy and sorrow. Sorrow over my sin and joy over the
      fact that I just met the king of the universe, Jesus.</p>

    <p>In that moment I knew that God was real, Lord Jesus was real, Heaven was real, Hell was real, eternal life was real,
      the Bible was real, God was like “This is who I am, this is who you are, you are now in my Kingdom, you are now my
      child, and we are now reconciled, and we have a relationship”, and I was like “God! You have my whole life, like this
      is it, it’s all yours”.</p>

    <p>When I was living that gay life and for many many years, I was a hundred percent sure that was my identity, I felt like
      I was born that way, it was my orientation, it was my identity, and I felt like it was immutable. And one of the things
      that also happened during that moment of conversion was that I knew beyond the shadow of the doubt, that homosexuality
      was not who I was, that my identity was in Christ, that, that was not who I was.</p>

    <p>This is the issue, the deal breaker, homosexuality is the deal breaker for LGBT community when it comes to Christianity,
      and I felt the same way. People always say “well isn’t it unloving to say that homosexuality is a sin”, and am like
      “no its unloving to let people spend eternity apart from God, that’s unloving”.</p>

    <p>This life is a vapor, this life is a mist, it’s like two seconds long, eternity is a long time, and whether you believe
      it or not, we are all going to face Christ on the last day, and we are either going to be under His mercy or under
      His wrath, that’s the bottom line. And whether you believe that or not, that’s going to happen, that’s what is at stake.</p>

    <p>Do you want just this kind of temporary pleasure right now or do you want eternity with God? Do not let this one issue,
      and I know it’s a very powerful strong issue, but do not let this issue prevent you from eternity with God.</p>
