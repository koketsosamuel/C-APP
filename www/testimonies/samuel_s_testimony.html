    <p>My name is Samuel, and as of 2018 am 18 years old and this is my testimony.</p>

    <p>In primary school I was a regular guy who had friends who were popular at school, so I wasn’t oppressed or bullied at
      primary school because I had some back-up and friends who would be there to fight for me and alongside me. I remember
      that I was also not the best in school academics, however I was like almost always second, and a few times first, I
      never got any awards for my whole primary school years and I remember the fact that I used to look at the guy who was
      better than me at academics and think to myself
      <i>“wow, God has blessed some people more than others. This guy has good looks, his family is financially balanced, and
        he is the best learner in the whole school, I wish I could be him”</i>.</p>

    <p>In primary school I was also very selfish, although most times I shared my answers with my close friends who were not
      able to get good marks on their tests, I was also abusive to some few peers, I did a lot of bad things in my primary
      school, as well as at home. In fact, at home I was getting beat up by my parents almost every week for doing something
      wrong and I remember myself having suicidal thoughts because I felt like they did not love me and I blamed myself whenever
      they called me names or beat me up. I also used to be doubtful of whether they were truly my parents or not because
      I felt they did not love me.</p>

    <p>At some point in primary school I started to fall deeply in love with technology and understanding it, it firstly started
      with cellphones and later grew into idolizing computers, I felt like computers gave me an identity and they made me
      feel smart, whenever I got an internet connection I would research about computer hardware, software and applications,
      and my knowledge about computers grew very quickly and by the time I got to my eighth grade in high school I was already
      consumed in computers, and the funny thing is that I didn’t even own a computer at that time, until my parents bought
      me a second-hand computer during my grade 9 year.</p>

    <p>Besides computers, I was also into video gaming, as well as dancing even though I wasn’t that good, and as a result I
      quit dancing the same year I started it. To make this story short I will summarize my past life by describing myself
      as a broken, lost, evil and careless young man, who actually did believe in God, prayed sometimes, but never actually
      gave God any attention or thought.</p>

    <p>It was in 2016 in my eleventh grade where I got in the same class with some guy I had known in grade 10, and this guy
      didn’t have a desk to sit on and so I invited him to sit next to me just because I saw him as a funny guy, and I was
      willing to have him as my daily company. The guy was not a Christian at that time but he had some biblical knowledge
      and he was very interested in
      <i>“science”</i> at that time, so as time went on we got along very well, we exchanged contacts and spoke on WhatsApp,
      and one day he sent me a video which was talking about how the so-called
      <i>“scientists”</i> are trying to hide God from us by using nonsense theories like
      <i>“evolution”</i>,
      <i>“big bang”</i>, and etc.</p>

    <p>From that single video I just started wanting more and more, and we started learning about the secrets of the catholic
      church, the illuminatti, skull and bones, free masonry and etc. and just like that we suddenly started to talk with
      each other about God for many hours, usually after school and on weekends, and I remember that we used to enjoy it
      a lot, in fact, we still enjoy it even today, God would also give us revelations at those times and teach us about
      many things. And I don’t know how but I also started reading and understanding the Bible, and I realized that things
      in my life started to change, I started to tell people about God, I started losing interest in many things, in fact
      I quit gaming, and stopped idolizing computers, and started loving people, loving God, doing the Will of God, serving
      God, praising God, having a relationship with God and appreciating the creations of God and their complexity and splendor.
      And at that time I didn’t know that this sort of event meant that I was born again. And sinning was no longer an easy
      thing to do, because it caused me great pain and guilt to sin against the same God who loved me and gave His Son the
      Lord Jesus Christ for me, even when I was His enemy at that time and a friend of the world.</p>

    <p>Not to forget that I also didn’t have any problem with drinking alcohol and going to taverns in December times, even
      though it wasn’t really my thing. I presently hate alcohol, and when I look back at the old me, all I can say is
      <i>“farewell, I never want to be you ever again, you were evil, selfish, an idolater, immoral, dead, lost and broken”</i>,
      and the new me might not be perfect, but he is alive, he knows the truth, and knows that the only way to the Father
      is the Lord Jesus Christ. My primary goal is to get into Heaven where God is, and to absolutely be perfect before God,
      as well as to stop sinning completely.</p>

    <p>Am very thankful to God for His grace for someone as evil as I was, and for making me a new creature who has a heart
      of flesh, not a heart of stone, and again for the Holy Spirit who guides me, reveals the truth and teaches me many
      things including the fact that am not better than anyone and am not supposed to ever fall into traditions of men which
      pervert the Gospel in order to accustom for their worldly desires, as well as to test every spirit to see if it is
      from God.</p>

    <p>The truth I learned, not only from my testimony, is that God is not the church, so your allegiance to the church is not
      an allegiance to God, we should have personal relationships with God on our own and depend on Him, not a pastor, or
      friend, or anyone else. And you are not born again, if you feel like you were never a “bad” person, or if you are still
      the same.</p>

    <p>God is true, God loves me, God forgave me, God gave His Son for me, God created me, God listens to me, God responds to
      me, God gives me advice about things in my life, God looks over me, God has a relationship with me, God sustains me,
      God reveals the truth to me, God blesses me with knowledge, God blesses me with wisdom and many many more things, possibly
      more than I can ever know! He can do the same for you or possibly even more!</p>

    <p>I Am a born again Christian.</p>
