    <p>Here's what you need to do: you've got to first shave your head, you dress all in black, you've got to wear a white robe,
      eat only kosher foods, you've got to become a vegetarian, you face Jerusalem, you've got to face India when you pray,
      you pray only in Hebrew, and you grow a nice, big beard. And if you do all of those outward, cultural things, you'll
      discover the God of the
      <i>Heavens and the Earth</i>.</p>

    <p>And am thinking this is crazy that someone thinks that they can force their culture on God and that God's going to be
      impressed by what you wear, what direction you face when you pray, what you eat, and all these sorts of things. It
      seemed to me that if there was a God out there who could be known, He should be able to be recognized no matter where
      I face, no matter how I'm dressed, because He is God.</p>

    <p>Growing up, we always understood that we had our Bible(
      <i>without the New Testament</i>) and the gentiles(
      <i>Non-Jews, Christians in this case</i>) had their Bible, the New Testament, and they were two completely separate books.
      Because the only people I knew who were believers in
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus were all Italian Catholic, I imagined that
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus was Italian and so the understanding that he's actually Jewish was a shock. And the to hear that the
      New Testament was written by Jews...I couldn't believe it. My expectation was that the New Testament was like my grandparents
      had told me
      <i>that</i> it was a book on how to persecute the Jews, and something you should stay away from. Of course when you are
      told you should stay away from something, curiosity gets the best of you and you've got to see it.</p>

    <p>When I opened the New Testament, I was expecting to find a handbook on how to persecute the Jews. My grandparents had
      warned me that it was written by people who killed the Jews. That's what I was expecting to see, and then when I'm
      opening it, I'm reading a story written by Jews about Jewish people. The New Testament was a fascinating book, and
      so as I opened this book in the library, I kind of looked around, made sure that none of my friends had seen me taking
      a Christian Bible off the shelf. I opened it, and here's the first sentence: it says "This is the genealogy of Jesus
      the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham...", so three people are mentioned and they're all Jewish.</p>

    <p>I was very shocked, and as I continued to read, I'm reading the story of a Jewish man who was born in a Jewish village
      in a Jewish country, and one day walks into a synagogue and announces that He is the Messiah. The more I read the words
      of
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus, the more I became attracted to Him, it was as beautiful as anything I'd ever read in any other part
      of the Bible.</p>

    <p>As I came to faith Yeshua(
      <i>Hebrew name of Lord Jesus</i>), that
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus was the Messiah, it was clear that that was the most Jewish thing I could do. This is not a person who
      is a renegade to our people, this is the One who was promised in our Bible(
      <i>Jewish Bible</i>). The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, it is astonishing. If you would just read that chapter without
      the Bible being around it, you would say, "Uh! This is some Christian Bible - this is
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus". When you realize though that it's in the middle of our Bible, our Jewish Bible... When I first came
      to faith I dared not tell my father because this is a time period in the 1970's when there were lots of gurus and cults
      and he was very concerned about me getting involved in some crazy sect and going off some place, so I waited for months
      and when I finally told him, he was very skeptical.</p>

    <p>On his own, he started to read about
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus as well. About a year and a half later, I told him that the fellow who wrote one of the books he had
      read, that this fellow was giving a lecture in the city of New of York, and he agreed to come out to hear that person.
      And one of the most amazing moments of my life was, the speaker said, "Would everyone here who is a Jewish believer
      in
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus, would you raise your hand" and I raised my hand. My father also raised his hand. And I looked over
      and I said, "Pop, he didn't say would all the Jews raise their hands, he said would would all the Jewish believers
      in
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus raise their hand" and my father looked over and he said "Yes, I heard what he said".</p>

    <p>The decision to come to faith in
      <i>Lord</i> Jesus as the Messiah was not something that was a momentary lark, it wasn't something that was a passing fad
      and I could see changes in myself that I knew were not from within myself. I had kind of tapped into a truth for our
      Jewish people that was very powerful.</p>
