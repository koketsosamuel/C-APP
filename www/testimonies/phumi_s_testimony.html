    <p>My name is Phumi.</p>

    <p>I was one those Christians who “knew” Jesus, but did not really obey what was written in the Bible. Here is my story
      before I believed that Jesus is the Saviour. It all started in December, a month where everyone plans who they will
      meet, what type of alcoholic drink they will drink, and who they will be dancing with.</p>

    <p>I too had those plans; I was known as the greatest dancer. But something told me to read the Bible. That was my first
      time I read the Bible. It felt so interesting; for the first time I felt a connection between me and God. This feeling
      made me to repent, and to follow Jesus. As I read the Bible, I asked myself, am I really a true Christian, and where
      will I go if die? because the Bible says not everyone will go to heaven, but only those who do the will of the Lord.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven – only the one who does the will
        of my Father in heaven.</p>

    <p>I then asked my mom so many questions about Christianity and I also attended teenage workshops. The word of the Lord
      spoke to me. “Do not the love the world so much.” I became so confused and asked myself what this message really means.
      The Holy Spirit Himself told me that a Christian should not do what people in the world do, but to seek the Kingdom
      of God. I decided to make the biggest decision–to be a born-again Christian. I was baptized by the Father, The Son
      and the Holy Spirit. I was born by flesh, but now I am born by spirit in heaven. The angels praise when someone is
      born in heaven.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">“Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture
        and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it? Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders,
        rejoicing. Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I
        have found my sheep that was lost.’ I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner
        who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.</p>

    <p>I always thank God for the day he warned me about loving new technology and fashion, because the devil attracts Christians
      with all these things (and with many other things). I don’t say fellow Christians shouldn’t buy these things, but beware
      of Beelzebub seeking for your soul. We are living in the last days–it is now your time to choose between Jesus or the
      devil. Jesus loves you! I am only 18 years old, but I have surrendered to Christ. It is your choice . . .</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">
        Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent, the devil, is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
