    <p>Our hope should be in God! For what is impossible for God? He is the grand deliverer, the grand provider, the grand healer,
      the saviour who gave us Lord Jesus our salvation, the creator of Heaven and Earth, even pagans call Him the Most High
      God!
    </p>

    <p>However, having hope in God is much different than having hope in man or anything materialistic. Hope in God is when
      you look at a sea and still believe that there can a way in the middle of that sea! Looking at a dead man and still
      believe that he can be woken up! Looking at a blind man and still believe that his eyes can be opened and sight can
      be given to him, so that he may see! Looking at a crippled man and still believe that he can be healed and walk upright!
      Looking at a boy and still believe that he can be strengthened to overthrow a well-trained warrior! Looking at the
      furnace of blazing fire and believe that you can be thrown in and yet be delivered out of that fire alive and perfectly
      well! Looking at a man being thrown into a lion’s den, but still believe he can be delivered out of that den without
      a scratch! Looking at a man persecuting believers of the living gospel of Lord Jesus Christ, but still believe that,
      that man can one day be converted into a true believer! Hope in God is limitless, no situation is great enough to shatter
      the hope given to us by God through His strength, love, holiness, mercy, deliverance, glory, presence and completeness!</p>

    <p>But I believe hope in God does not mean that you will choose or that you should choose how God is to deliver you from
      that situation! Having hope in God involves the belief that God is not limited by your mind and that God is higher
      than you! And therefore you just believe that God can deliver you from that difficult situation, but as to how, you
      do not know! And this is because if you limit how God can deliver you from that situation and decide how God should
      deliver you then you might end up feeling like God has failed you, and your hope in his ability might also be shattered!
      Have hope in God in the right way!</p>

    <p>You may be sad, believing you will never heal from that pain you are feeling, but have hope in God and submit to Him.
      Remember that Lazarus was sick, and later died, but the Lord Jesus Christ showed up four days later, a moment you and
      I would recognize as late. But even though the situation looked sealed, Martha did not lose hope and instead she said
      "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
      <i>But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.</i>", and the Lord Jesus Christ turned their
      sadness and mourning into praises and worship towards God by raising Lazarus from the dead.</p>

    <p>Even though you may not be delivered from that pain, disease, disability or what ever situation you are in, right here
      on Earth you must remember that Lazarus(the one in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus) died as a poor and sick
      man, but he ended up in Heaven where I believe God wiped all his tears away and comforted him.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary"> "There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. But at his gate lay
        a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores, who longed to eat what fell from the rich man's table.
        In addition, the dogs came and licked his sores. "Now the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's
        side. The rich man also died and was buried. And in Hades, as he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far
        off with Lazarus at his side. So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip
        of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this fire.' But Abraham said, 'Child, remember
        that in your lifetime you received your good things and Lazarus likewise bad things, but now he is comforted here
        and you are in anguish.</p>

    <p>Don't commit suicide, and don't blame God, Just have Hope in God! Let go, and let God! And by that statement I simply
      mean stop trying to fix your life, stop trying to make yourself happy, stop trying to do things your own way, and let
      God fix you, let God bring you joy, and let God do things His way!</p>
