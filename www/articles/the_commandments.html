    <!-- Post Content -->

    <p>I have heard many people say “we are no longer living under the law but under grace”, and by this many of these people
      if not all, actually mean that we do not have to obey the commandments any more as the Lord Jesus Christ died for our
      sins. But is this really true? Have the laws of God become insignificant?</p>

    <p>The truth is NO! The laws of God are not insignificant, they are important and still relevant! Just as the Lord Jesus
      taught that He did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it!</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill
        them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter will pass
        from the law until everything takes place.</p>

    <p>The laws will always be relevant as long as Heaven and Earth have not passed away! But however the laws are no longer
      what take us to Heaven! That’s what actually changed, and if by the statement “we are no longer living under the law
      but under grace”, you actually just mean that the law is no longer our way to Heaven, but the grace of God revealed
      to us through the Lord Jesus Christ is our way to heaven then I completely agree with you!</p>

    <p>And again we must remember that those who have received the Holy Spirit of God are those who are born-again, those of
      whom we call “new creatures” are the ones who desire to be perfect in all their ways, just as the Apostle Paul tells
      us that we should flee from doing wrong things! And that we should not continue to do the wrong things.</p>


    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? Absolutely not! How can we who died to
        sin still live in it?</p>

    <p>This article is not hard to understand if you are a born-again believer with a true testimony! The obedience of the commandments
      is the evidence of your faith, and as we all know that we receive this amazingly huge grace of God through faith, so
      if you do not have faith then you are not living under grace, but under a curse, and your works are the evidence of
      your faith, and your faith is the only way to receiving the grace of God.</p>

    <p>Faith is like the air, we may not see the air but we can see the trees it shakes, we can feel the temperature changes
      it causes and etc.</p>

    <p>Faith is the source of your works, if you have faith then your works will automatically show that you do have the faith.
      By faith am referring to “Believing the Gospel”, and by works am referring to fruitfulness and productivity in the
      things of God, not the things of church, but the things of God which in the case of this article is obedience!</p>


    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">But would you like evidence, you empty fellow, that faith without works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified
        by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? You see that his faith was working together with his works and
        his faith was perfected by works.</p>

    <p>Am not saying that only perfect obedience to the law is the evidence of whether you are living under grace or not, but
      your eagerness, passion and desire for perfection before God, is something that will tell you about your spiritual
      life. Just like the Apostle Paul said below:</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold, since Christ Jesus
        has also laid hold of me.</p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">
        <cite title="Source Title">Philemon 3:12</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Yes, we should obey the commandments, even though we are not forced to, but because we would love to, and the Holy Spirit
      inspires us to do so! And as new creatures we desire to be like the Lord Jesus Christ. In fact, the question “Should
      we obey the commandments?” is irrelevant to true Christians who have the Holy Spirit living within them, it is obvious
      like the Apostle Paul asked “How can we who died to sin still live in it?”, the answer is obviously the fact that we
      can’t still live in sin if we have died to it.</p>
