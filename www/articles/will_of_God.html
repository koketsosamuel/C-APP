    <!-- Post Content -->
    <p>The Will of God is defined as “what God wants”. For example, saying “the Will of God is not for us to die and go to Hell,
      but that we may believe in His Son and therefore receive everlasting life” is the same as saying “what God wants is
      not for us to die and go to Hell, but that we may believe in His Son and therefore receive everlasting life”.
    </p>

    <p>You know sometimes as people we want a lot of things, we want to be educated, we want to marry or be married, we want
      cars, we want houses, we want children, we want to be healthy, we want to be famous, we want jobs, we want to preach
      about God, we want to start churches, we want job promotions, we want money and many more things.</p>


    <p>But have you ever stopped and asked God what He wants for you, or what He wants from you? If you truly believe that God
      is your creator, then you must also believe that God knows you more than you know yourself. And if God knows you more
      than you know yourself then you must also believe that God knows what is best for you, that God knows how to make you
      happy, God knows what will satisfy you, and that God knows everything you need, even the needs you don’t realize you
      have.
    </p>


    <p>What God wants is what we should want, let’s forget about what we want, and focus on what God wants for us, as well as
      what God wants for others, and what God wants for His creations. If we want to live lives of holiness and perfection
      then let’s forget about everything we want, and everything people want for us and just focus on what God wants. What
      God wants is best, better than what we would ever suggest.</p>


    <p>In the past I wanted to be a computer technician with all my heart, but what God wanted for me was different, it was
      that I should be His child. And today I am His child and know that being His child is a thousand times better than
      being anything on earth. Wow, being a child of God is so beautiful that I cried when writing this paragraph, remembering
      how many times God forgave me just spilled those tears of joy out of my eyes. Wow the Will of God truly is best, and
      I am a witness. Don’t you want to be a witness too?</p>


    <p>Doing the Will of God is amazing, and not doing the Will of God is very dangerous and the Bible provides us with a very
      very clear example of how dangerous it is to not do the Will of God.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of Heaven – only the one who does the will
        of my Father in Heaven. On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and in your
        name cast out demons and do many powerful deeds?’ Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Go away from me,
        you lawbreakers!’</p>

        <cite title="Source Title">Matthew 7:21 - 23 (Lord Jesus Christ)</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Again I repeat, let’s forget about what we want and what others want, then focus on what God wants and do what God wants.
    </p>


    <p>Pray to God and say “my God, forgive me for all the times I ignored what you want and focused on what I want and what
      others want, I want to do what you want me to do, I want to dress how you want me to dress, I want to smell how you
      want me to smell, I want to look how you want me to look, I want to listen to what you want me to listen to, I want
      to watch what you want me to watch, and I want to be want what you want me to be. Help me, please help me, I want to
      live by your Will and die by your Will, Amen in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
