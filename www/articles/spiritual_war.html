    <!-- Post Content -->
    <p>Wake up, and arm yourself with spiritual weapons of prayer and faith against our spiritual enemies! Look the devil and
      his army want to distract you with jobs, money, romance, sex, power and worldliness so that you may not realize that
      there is a spiritual war going on, and that way they will easily defeat you as you will be sleeping and relaxed.</p>

    <p>We are to be soldiers of Christ, fighting the good fight of faith, arming ourselves with spiritual weapons and never
      relaxing. The devil and his army do not relax, they are constantly launching their missiles of atheism, buddhism, islam,
      satanism, luciferism, false Christianity, hypocrisy, immorality, self-worship, idolatry, sorcery, food poisoning, canabalism,
      LGBT, boastfulness, and many more missiles, and as a result many many people have fallen to these missiles. Our spiritual
      enemies have even made their way into churches and deceived people into practicing doctrines of demons rather than
      listening to our Lord and Master Jesus Christ.</p>

        spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>

    <p>Our spiritual enemies have even deceived people into believing that other people are actually their real enemies while
      they are our hidden enemies, our spiritual enemies masquerade as angels of light, they pretend to be loving and caring
      just so that they can eventually lead us to destruction. I actually even believe that the devil and his demons even
      pretend to be the Holy Spirit of God to some lost people who do not test every spirit to see if it is from God. The
      devil and his army also perform miracles to deceive people into worshipping them.</p>

    <p>Look our enemies are active, powerful, smart and very cruel, you and I can’t defend ourselves from them, we need Master
      Jesus, because to Him as the Son of God, they are nothing! Master Jesus is the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the
      Lamb of God, and He will come with His unstoppable Heavenly army and send them to hell. So we should just stick very
      close to Lord Jesus and keep praying without ceasing.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings…</p>

    <p>Don’t sleep, and don’t relax, there is war going on! And Master Jesus is our only shepherd who will defend and fight
      for us, let us just submit under His Lordship and we will surely be victorious.</p>


    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent, the devil, is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to
        devour.
