    <p>We all know what darkness is, it is what causes us to switch on our lights, candles or torches at night. To be in darkness
      is to be in a very dangerous situation because in darkness our eyes are useless, we are not different from blind people
      when we are in darkness. In darkness we do not know the difference between a friend and an enemy, darkness is a state
      of being absolutely lost, and placing your trust on wrong things and wrong persons. When you are in darkness the devil
      can come to you and convince you that the Lord Jesus Christ is your enemy. In darkness the devil can convince you that
      he is God, and you have to praise and worship him, while in return he gives you money, fame, power and assurance that
      you are living life to the fullest. Yes, a lot of horrible things are possible in darkness, this is the reason why
      we see many people following false religions like Atheism, Hinduism, Satanism, Islam, Luciferism, Buddhism, and etc.</p>

    <p>Darkness is not to be valued, but to be abandoned. Let’s love the Saving light and live in the Saving light, which is
      our Lord Jesus Christ. To love and have the saving light in your life you must invite the Lord Jesus Christ to come
      into your life and allow him to dominate your life, because he is the saving light sent into the world by God. If you
      don’t do this you might end up as an atheist, Buddhist, Muslim, monk, and etc. an example I can give you is found in
      the false Israelites who claim to be Jews, Israel is not a Jewish country and the reason for this is because they rejected
      the light and for this reason they perished as they created a new false religion which believes in doctrines of demons
      which come from the Talmud and other instruments of their new religion which is far from God. Not only did these false
      Israelites reject the light, but they also reviled Him in a very horrible way that I don’t even feel like I should
      write their insults against the Son of God for you to see. They are not Jews if they do not submit to the Lord Jesus
      Christ, although a few do believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and they are the true Israelites.</p>

    <p>The same thing with Islam and every other false religion, they reject the light and sometimes they create their own false
      Christ so that they can mislead people. If you reject the light you will go to Hell, because you will hate those who
      love you, misplace your trust, be selfish, be envious and worship idols like money, beauty, fame, power and etc.</p>

    <p>Lord Jesus Christ is the saving light of the world sent to us by the Father, so let us live in that light so that we
      may be able to differentiate between enemies and friends, between lies and the truth, between good and evil, between
      life and death, between Heaven and Hell, and lastly but very importantly, so that we may be able to know who God is,
      how to serve him, and who Lord Jesus Christ truly is.</p>

    <p>If you have the saving light in your life then you should be grateful to God because without the light we are doomed,
      but with the saving light we are blessed. If you are not sure whether you have the saving light in your life or not,
      then you can say this prayer from your heart to the Almighty God our creator, “God, I am unsure of whether I received
      the saving light or not, and so today I realize that I need the saving light that you sent into the world, because
      I know I am doomed and obviously going to Hell if I don’t receive the saving light into my life, this is because the
      Lord Jesus Christ is the saving light and whoever receives him receives you, as the Lord Jesus Christ is the only way
      to you. God I believe that truly you sent him into the world not to condemn the world, but to give us an opportunity
      to reconciled with you, yes I believe that Jesus is the Lord and he died for my sins, and even though he died, you
      raised him from the dead. God I want you to be my God, the one I serve, love, respect and worship all days of my life,
      God may your will be done over this prayer and all things, Amen in the name of Lord Jesus”.</p>
