    <hr>


    <!-- Post Content -->
    <p>To most people the church is a building, a place or a tent where you can connect with God and meet with other people
      who believe in God. The Cambridge dictionary also says that the church is a building for Christian religious activities.</p>

    <p>However, it might shock you to find out that according to the Bible it is impossible for the Church to be a building,
      a place or a tent. According to the Bible, the Church can talk, it can move, and it can be found inside houses! I don’t
      know about you but I personally don’t know any buildings that can move, talk or even be found inside houses!</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">The
        <u>churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you</u>. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, with
        the
        <u>church that meets in their house</u>.
      </p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">
        <cite title="Source Title">1Corinthians 16:19</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But I know that people can move, talk, and be found inside houses. The truth is that according to the Bible the Church
      is not a building, it is a group of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. The word “Church” is a word representing the
      Greek word “ekklesia” which is defined as “a called out assembly of the Redeemed of Jesus”.</p>


    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">to the
        <u>church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus</u>, and called to be saints, with
        all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.
      </p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">
        <cite title="Source Title">1Corinthians 1:2</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Another thing that makes it impossible for the Church to be a building, tent or place, is the fact that in the Bible,
      the Church is mentioned as the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Which are exclusively those who believe in Him.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">Now
        <u>you are Christ’s body</u>, and each of you is a member of it.
      </p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">
        <cite title="Source Title">1Corinthians 12:27</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So the next time someone asks you about where you go to Church, tell them you don’t go to Church, you are the Church.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">Do you not know that
        <u>you are God’s temple</u> and that God’s Spirit lives in you? If someone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him.
        For God’s temple is holy, which is what you are.
      </p>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer">
        <cite title="Source Title">1Corinthians 3:16 - 17</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To simplify this issue, I would simply say that the Church is not a building, a place, or a tent, but it is the Congregation
      of God, or that the Church is the assembly of God. It is those who are truly born again and filled with the Holy Spirit!</p>

    <p>Early Bible translations made it very easy for us to understand what the Church is by translating the greek word “ekklesia”
      as “congregation” or “assembly”, and not even once as “church”.</p>

    <p>I repeat, you are the Church!</p>
