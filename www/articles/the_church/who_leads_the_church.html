    <p>The Lord Jesus Christ calls Himself as “the Good Shepherd”, and He calls us as His sheep. A Shepherd is someone who takes
      care of the sheep and leads the sheep. The sheep are lost without the Shepherd, and in our case the Lord Jesus Christ
      is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. He is our Leader, not anyone else, He is our only Leader and we are all equals.

    <p>The conclusion I can give you about our leader is that our leader is the Lord Jesus Christ and without Him we are completely
      lost, just like sheep without a shepherd, without Him we are in darkness because He is our Light! And this is my final
      conclusion because the verses I quoted are where the Lord Jesus Christ confirms what am saying, so arguing with me
      means that you are also arguing with the Lord Jesus Christ because what am telling you comes from Him.</p>

        the flood came, and the winds beat against that house, but it did not collapse because its foundation had been laid
        on rock.

    <p>You will agree with me if you have laid your foundation on the rock!</p>
