    <hr>


    <!-- Post Content -->
    <p>I believe that with the issue of the behaviour of the church we can refer to the book of Acts and the teachings of Master
      Jesus Himself.</p>

    <p>Number, as to number the church begins from just two people who have gathered in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">For
        <u>where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there among them</u>.”
      </p>

    <p>Place of gathering, the church can gather in any place withouth distraction, an examples include houses just as many
      churches in the New Testament are recorded gathering inside of houses.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord,
        <u>with the church that meets in their house</u>.
      </p>

    <p>Offerings and tithes, the church of God participates on free will offering out of love not out of obligation, and the
      offering made by the church is not meant for the benefit of one person but for every one according their own needs.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">For there was not a needy person among them, because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds
        of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles’ feet.
        <u>This was then distributed for each person’s basic needs
        </u>.
      </p>

    <p>Rankings, the church of God does not have rankings, there are no bigger Christians who are always the ones getting the
      spotlight and special recognition. There are no bigger Christians who sit in special chairs, eat in special plates
      and drink in special glasses, everyone is equal in the church of God.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and
        <u>you are all brethren</u>.
      </p>

    <p>Members, the members of a Christian church can only be Christians. Preaching the Gospel was meant for sinners so that
      they can repent and believe the Gospel and therefore be added to the church of God since the church is the body of
      Christ. Non-believers cant be the body of Christ, and therefore they cant be part of the church because the church
      is the body of Christ. The definition of “ekklesia” also states that the church is a called out assembly of those who
      are saved by Master Jesus.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">praising God and having the good will of all the people.
        <u>And the Lord was adding to their number every day those who were being saved</u>.
      </p>

    <p>Days of gathering, there are no commands about on which days to gather, but the church in the book of Acts gathered every
      day and this is something I would personally recommend for all believers because the Lord Jesus Christ says that whenever
      two or more are gathered in His name He is also among them, so gathering everyday is like spending everyday with the
      Lord Jesus Christ, and I personally believe that this would be the best thing ever.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">
        <u>Every day they continued to gather together</u> by common consent in the temple courts, breaking bread from house
        to house, sharing their food with glad and humble hearts</p>

    <p>The Father, the church of God has only one Father, there are no spiritual fathers in the church, and the is no such thing
      as “father in the faith” with the church of God. God is the only one whom the church of God acknowledges as the Father.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">And
        <u>call no one your ‘father’ on earth</u>, for
        <u>you have one Father, who is in heaven</u>.
      </p>

    <p>Tongues, tongues are simply languages according to the Bible and simple logic. The church of God recognizes and believes
      in the gift of tongues, but it also understands that the gift of tongues is not some useless repetitive babling, the
      gift of tongues is meant for communication with people who can not hear your own language and not for noise, and the
      one who speaks in tongues must be able to hear what he/she is saying because the Holy Spirit is not like a possessive
      demon who controls you, the Holy Spirit is a helper who makes suggestions and gives you the power of choice to finalize
      the outcome.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">“And I shall ask the Father, and He shall give you another
        <u>Helper</u>, to stay with you forever –
