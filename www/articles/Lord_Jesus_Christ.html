    <p>This is the simplest question to true Christians, because you would be asking them about their king, their Lord, their
      elder brother, their salvation and their only door to the Father. They don’t know about Him, they know Him. He is the
      one who they use His name to talk to the Father.</p>

    <p>This is how I know Him:</p>

    <p>He is the Son of God, the one who is absolutely dependent on God, the one who recognizes that God is high, and that God
      is even higher than Him. Lord Jesus is the only one whom I can call a representation of God our Father, He is the one
      who loves the laws of the Almighty God. The doer of the Will of God. He is the good Shepherd who laid down his life
      for His sheep. The one who does not do things to get glory of men, He is one who does things to Glorify the Father.
      The one who lived perfectly on earth even though He was tempted. The one who is higher than David, the one who is higher
      than Solomon, and He is the one who existed even before Abraham. He is the great high priest. He is the expression
      of the wonderful Grace of God. He is the Truth, the Way and the Life, and if any man enters through Him, he will be
      saved. He is the great key which can open any lock, He is the heavy hammer which smashes all types of slave chains,
      and He is the sufficient payment for all types of sins. I say that as a witness not just a reader.</p>

    <p>Lord Jesus Christ is one who lived perfectly upon the earth but died like a sinner, because He was sent by the Father
      so that He may carry our sins and be punished for them, and by doing that we were given an opportunity to holiness
      just as God is Holy, and finally be saved from Hell. The Lord Jesus Christ being crucified on the cross for sinners
      like me and you, reveals to us two things about Him,one, He was prepared to do any work that God gave Him even if it
      took His life. secondly, it tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the true representation of true love that surpasses
      logic, and the love He represents is the love which is super, mega, radiant, grandeur and incomparable, and that love
      is the Love of God. He is the one who was resurrected by the Father.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">For God so loved the world, that
        <u>He gave His only-begotten Son</u>, that whoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, He is the one who knows the Father, and lets us know that it is not possible to know God if He does
      not reveal him to you. And if you know God then you know the Lord Jesus Christ, because the Lord Jesus Christ represents
      the Father. And He is the author and finisher of faith, because without him I personally know that my faith would be
      dead and without works, but with Him it is alive and it produces good fruit.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father
        except the Son and anyone to whom the Son decides to reveal him.</p>
