    <p>My God, my God, why hast thou not forsaken me?</p>

    <p>Lord Jesus Christ cried out saying "my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?", sinners cried out saying the opposite,
      asking God why He has not forsaken them. They couldn't understand why God would give so much love, and so much of a
      sacrifice for them! They were the worst of people but they received the best gift, Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the
      Living God! I am one of those sinners, and I am really amazed that Christ died for me, He didn't let me sink into Hell,
      He gave me an opportunity to go Heaven!</p>

    <p>I won't tell you am going to Heaven, but I will tell you that I have an opportunity to go Heaven, and my opportunity
      is only found in believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and Lord of lords! If I sink into Hell it will
      be because I rejected Him and didn't repent. Not because God doesn't love me, but because of my rejection of the Lord
      and disobedience.</p>

    <p>You and I, have equal opportunities to be able to make it into Heaven, our opportunity is the Lord Jesus Christ, all
      we have to do is to have faith in Him and repent, and we should definitely make sure we have faith in the right Lord
      Jesus Christ, because there are deceivers who to claim to be him, and those who claim to know Him. The Lord Jesus Christ
      is the Son of God, our salvation, our revelation of God's grace and love! And He died for us! But He is alive because
      God raised him from the dead.</p>

    <p>There is no other Lord Jesus Christ, except the one I just told you about as according to the Bible and the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>Our spiritual enemies have even deceived people into believing that other people are actually their real enemies while
      they are our hidden enemies, our spiritual enemies masquerade as angels of light, they pretend to be loving and caring
      just so that they can eventually lead us to destruction. I actually even believe that the devil and his demons even
      pretend to be the Holy Spirit of God to some lost people who do not test every spirit to see if it is from God. The
      devil and his army also perform miracles to deceive people into worshipping them.</p>

    <p>Look our enemies are active, powerful, smart and very cruel, you and I can’t defend ourselves from them, we need Master
      Jesus, because to Him as the Son of God, they are nothing! Master Jesus is the King of kings, the Lord of lords, the
      Lamb of God, and He will come with His unstoppable Heavenly army and send them to hell. So we should just stick very
      close to Lord Jesus and keep praying without ceasing.</p>

    <p>Don’t sleep, and don’t relax, there is war going on! And Master Jesus is our only shepherd who will defend and fight
      for us, let us just submit under His Lordship and we will surely be victorious.</p>
