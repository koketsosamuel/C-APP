    <p>What is a Prayer? A Prayer is a method of communication with the Almighty God who created all things! A Prayer can be
      done at anytime and anywhere, meaning you can talk to God at anytime and anywhere! You might not get my point, but
      I’ll make this easy for you, can you talk to a mere school teacher at anytime or anywhere? Can you talk to a doctor
      at anytime or anywhere? Can you talk to a president at anytime or anywhere? Can you even talk to your friend or parent
      at anytime or anywhere?</p>

    <p>The answer to the questions I asked above is a simple “no”, you can’t talk to anyone on this earth at anytime or anywhere,
      you usually have to set appointments, or wait for that person to be free, sometimes the people on this Earth just don’t
      want to talk to you. But God, even with His great and incomprehensible power, allows us to talk to Him without setting
      an appointment, He allows us to talk to Him at anytime and anywhere, and not only does He allow us to talk to Him,
      He listens to our Prayers and He responds to them when He is willing and on His own time. In fact, as a personal testimony
      God has answered a lot of my Prayers!</p>


    <p>I hope that you can now understand that a Prayer is not a job that God has to pay you for doing, a Prayer is a blessing
      you have to thank God for allowing you to be able to do it, I hope that you can understand that when you are Praying
      you are not doing God a favor, God is actually the one doing you a favor by allowing you to talk to Him even though
      you are not perfect, even though you have sinned, even though you once went against Him and possibly even though you
      are now against Him!</p>


    <p>We have to pray, not because we are forced to but because it is an undeniable blessing to us.</p>

    <p>If you don’t know how to pray then you can start like this: “God, in the name of Lord Jesus Christ your Son”, then say
      whatever you want and end your Prayer with something like: “amen in the name of Lord Jesus Christ”. The reason why
      we communicate with God through the Lord Jesus Christ is because Lord Jesus is our only mediator with God. Another
      thing to know is that you can talk to God anywhere but it has to be private, and you can use your heart for privacy
      when you are in public places like malls, meaning you can pray to God in your heart when you are in public places,
      and avoid going against the teachings of our Master Jesus Christ.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0 text-primary bold">"Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street
        corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward! But whenever you pray, go into your
        inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.
        When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that by their many words they will
        be heard. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</p>

    <p>I hope God has blessed you with the understanding of the blessing of Prayer through a nobody like me.</p>
