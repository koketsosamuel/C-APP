    <!-- Post Content -->
    <p>You know I was planning on writing articles on false religions with separate focus on each of them, but I became a little
      frustrated when I realized that there are just a lot of them out there, some known and some unknown. And I believe
      it was the Holy Spirit who reminded me that I actually don’t need to know all false religions of the world because
      I already know them! And I know them with one simple characteristic, every religion that does not teach the Gospel
      of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the Bible is a false religion.</p>

    <p>A false religion does not believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the only way to the Father, even though some of them
      may claim that they believe and respect Him, they just don’t see Him as the only way to God. Most false religions believe
      in many gods and not one God as we know that in reality there is one God who is Almighty, Merciful, Gracious, Creative,
      and much more than I can ever comprehend.</p>



    <p>The most dangerous false religion I know, is the one that says it believes the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ but teaches
      something totally different from what He taught, the Lord Jesus Christ said “And call no man your father upon the Earth”,
      yet you hear a lot of people who call themselves Christian call their pastors and leaders “father”, this kind of religion
      should just be called “churchianity” because it is absolutely not about what the Lord Jesus Christ did and said, it
      is about church doctrine and tradition, something worse than the Pharisees.</p>

    <p>There are two categories of religions, and those categories are “Christianity” and “false religions”, Christianity is
      ruled over by God, and all false religions are ruled over by the devil. It’s that simple, its either God or satan,
      there is no in between! So it doesn’t matter what your religion or belief is, the absolute truth is, if its not Christianity
      then it is Satanism because every religion that is not Christianity is obviously ruled over by satan. Even some of
      the like Bhuddism, who come in the teachings of false peace without God, they are purely satanism.</p>
