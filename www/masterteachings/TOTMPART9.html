            <i>Matthew 7:13 - 23</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction, and there are
            many who go through it. How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it. “Beware
            of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravaging wolves.</p>

        <p class="">You’ll recognize them by their fruit. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes or figs from thistles? In the same way,
            every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit. A good tree can’t produce bad fruit;
            neither can a bad tree produce good fruit. Every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down and thrown
            into the fire.So you’ll recognize them by their fruit.


            <p class="">“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord! ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the
                will of My Father in heaven. On that day many will say to Me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in Your name,
                drive out demons in Your name, and do many miracles in Your name? ’ Then I will announce to them, ‘I never
                knew you! Depart from Me, you lawbreakers!’</p>
