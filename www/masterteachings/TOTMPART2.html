            <i>Matthew 5:13 - 26</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its flavor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good
            for anything except to be thrown out and trampled on by people! You are the light of the world. A city located
            on a hill cannot be hidden. People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives
            light to all in the house.</p>

        <p class="">In the same way, let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good deeds and give honor to your
            Father in heaven.</p>

        <p class="">“Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish these things but to
            fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke of a letter
            will pass from the law until everything takes place.</p>

        <p class="">So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom
            of heaven, but whoever obeys them and teaches others to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
            For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will
            never enter the kingdom of heaven!</p>

        <p class="">“You have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘Do not murder,’ and ‘whoever murders will be subjected
            to judgment.’ But I say to you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subjected to judgment. And whoever
            insults a brother will be brought before the council, and whoever says ‘Fool’ will be sent to fiery hell.</p>

        <p class="">So then, if you bring your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
            leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother and then come and present
            your gift.</p>

        <p class="">Reach agreement quickly with your accuser while on the way to court, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the
            judge hand you over to the warden, and you will be thrown into prison. I tell you the truth, you will never get
            out of there until you have paid the last penny!</p>
