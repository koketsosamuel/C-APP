        <h1 class="">THE WILL OF GOD</h1>
        <hr>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of
            my Father who is in heaven.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 12:46 - 50</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And while he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers were standing there outside, desiring
            to speak to him. And someone told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring
            to speak to you.” But he answered and said to the one who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
            And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold my mother and my brothers! For whoever does
            the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 18:12 - 14</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">What do you think? If someone owns a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine
            on the mountains and go look for the one that went astray? And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will
            rejoice more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. In the same way, your Father in heaven
            is not willing that one of these little ones be lost.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 21:28 - 32</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’
            The boy answered, ‘I will not.’ But later he had a change of heart and went. The father went to the other son
            and said the same thing. This boy answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but did not go. Which of the two did his father’s
            will?” They said, “The first. Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will
            go ahead of you into the kingdom of God! For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe
            him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe. Although you saw this, you did not later change your
            minds and believe him.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 6:29</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He sent.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Johm 6:38 - 40</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me. Now this is the will
            of the one who sent me – that I should not lose one person of every one he has given me, but raise them all up
            at the last day. For this is the will of my Father – for everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him to
            have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 8:28 - 29</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative,
            but I speak just what the Father taught me. And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because
            I always do those things that please him.”</p>
