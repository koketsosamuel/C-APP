        <h1 class="">PRAYER</h1>
        <hr>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:44</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 6:5 - 13</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on street
            corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward! But whenever you pray, go into
            your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will
            reward you. When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that by their many
            words they will be heard. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So pray
            this way: Our Father in heaven, may your name be honored, may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth
            as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our
            debtors. And do not lead us into hard testing, but deliver us from the evil one.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 26:41</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Mark 11:25</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will
            also forgive you your sins.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 6:28</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 21:36</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that must happen, and
            to stand before the Son of Man.</p>
