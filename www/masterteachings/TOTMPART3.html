            <i>Matthew 5:27 - 42</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to desire
            her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and
            throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</p>

        <p class="">If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than
            to have your whole body go into hell. “It was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a legal document.’
            But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever
            marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</p>

        <p class="">“Again, you have heard that it was said to an older generation, ‘Do not break an oath, but fulfill your vows to the
            Lord.’ But I say to you, do not take oaths at all – not by heaven, because it is the throne of God, not by earth,
            because it is his footstool, and not by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King. Do not take an oath
            by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</p>

        <p class="">Let your word be ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no.’ More than this is from the evil one. “You have heard that it was said, ‘An
            eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer. But whoever strikes you
            on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him
            have your coat also.</p>

        <p class="">And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to the one who asks you, and do not reject the one
            who wants to borrow from you.</p>
