        </h6>
        <p class="">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemy and
            pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be like your Father in heaven, since he causes the sun to rise
            on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</p>

        <p class="">For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don’t they? And
            if you only greet your brothers, what more do you do? Even the Gentiles do the same, don’t they? then, be perfect,
            as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
