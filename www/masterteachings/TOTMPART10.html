            <i>Matthew 7:24 - 29</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a sensible man who built his house
            on the rock. The rain fell, the rivers rose, and the winds blew and pounded that house. Yet it didn’t collapse,
            because its foundation was on the rock.</p>

        <p class="">But everyone who hears these words of Mine and doesn’t act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house
            on the sand. The rain fell, the rivers rose, the winds blew and pounded that house, and it collapsed. And its
            collapse was great! ”</p>

        <p class="">When Jesus had finished this sermon, the crowds were astonished at His teaching, because He was teaching them like
            one who had authority, and not like their scribes.</p>
