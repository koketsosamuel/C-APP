        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 4:17</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:3</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:10 - 12</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. Blessed are you
            when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me.
            Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets before you in the
            same way.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:19</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">So anyone who breaks one of the least of these commands and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom
            of heaven, but whoever obeys them and teaches others to do so will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:20</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will
            never enter the kingdom of heaven!
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:34</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But I say to you, do not take oaths at all – not by heaven, because it is the throne of God</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 6:1</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people. Otherwise you have no reward with your
            Father in heaven.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 6:10</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 6:19 - 21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and devouring insect destroy and where thieves break
            in and steal. But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and devouring insect do not destroy,
            and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven – only the one who does the will
            of my Father in heaven.
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 8:6 - 13</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish.” Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”
            But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof! Instead, just say the word
            and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one,
            ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this!’ and he does it. When Jesus
            heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith
            in anyone in Israel! I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac,
            and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where
            there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it
            will be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 10:7</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near!’
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 10:32 - 33</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Whoever, then, acknowledges me before people, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever denies
            me before people, I will deny him also before my Father in heaven.
        </p>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 18:1 - 4</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And calling
            to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and
            become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this
            child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 19:14</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs
            to such as these.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 19:23 - 26</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
            heaven! Again I say, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter
            into the kingdom of God.” The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said, “Then who can
            be saved?” Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but for God all things are
            possible.”
        </p>




        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 22:23 - 30</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">The same day Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to him and asked him, “Teacher,
            Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and father children for
            his brother.’ Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he
            had no children he left his wife to his brother. The second did the same, and the third, down to the
            seventh. Matt 22:27 Last of all, the woman died. In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the
            seven will she be? For they all had married her.” Jesus answered them, “You are deceived, because
            you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor
            are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</p>



        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 23:9</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And call no one your ‘father’ on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.</p>



        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 23:13</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“But woe to you, experts in the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You keep locking people out of the kingdom of
            heaven! For you neither enter nor permit those trying to enter to go in.</p>



        <h6>
            <i>Luke 10:20</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names stand written
            in heaven.”[REFERRING TO THE 72 HE HAD SENT FOR A MISSION]</p>



        <h6>
            <i>Luke 15:7</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine
            righteous people who have no need to repent.</p>



        <h6>
            <i>Revelation 3:12</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon
            him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
            heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</p>
