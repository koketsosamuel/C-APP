        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:1 - 12</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Do not judge, so that you won’t be judged. For with the judgment you use, you will be judged, and with the measure
            you use, it will be measured to you.</p>

        <p class="">Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye but don’t notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to
            your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and look, there’s a log in your eye? Hypocrite! First
            take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.</p>


        <p class="">Don’t give what is holy to dogs or toss your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them with their feet, turn,
            and tear you to pieces.</p>

        <p class="">“Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be
            opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who searches finds, and to the one who knocks, the
            door will be opened. What man among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks
            for a fish, will give him a snake?</p>


        <p class="">If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven
            give good things to those who ask Him! Therefore, whatever you want others to do for you, do also the same for
            them — this is the Law and the Prophets.</p>
