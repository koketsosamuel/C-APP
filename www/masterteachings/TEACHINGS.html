        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:24 - 29</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the
            rock. And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not
            collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not
            do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain came down and the rivers came
            and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great.” And it happened when
            Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who
            had authority, and not like their scribes.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 24:35</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Mark 8:38</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">For if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be
            ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 8:28</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Then Jesus said, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and I do nothing on my own initiative,
            but I speak just what the Father taught me.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 8:47</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">The one who is from God listens to God’s words. This is why you don’t listen, because you are not from God.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 12:48</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge; the word I have spoken will judge him at the last
            day.
