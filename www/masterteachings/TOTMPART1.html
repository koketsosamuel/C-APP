            <i>Matthew 5:1 - 12</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">On seeing the crowds of people, Jesus went up the hill; and, when he had taken his seat, his disciples came up to
            him; and he began to teach them, saying “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
            Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.</p>


        <p class="">Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful,
            for they will find mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers,
            for they will be called children of God.</p>

        <p class="">Blessed are those who have been persecuted in the cause of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed
            are you when people insult you, and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me. ​Be
            glad and rejoice, because your reward in heaven will be great; this is the way they persecuted the prophets who
            lived before you.</p>
