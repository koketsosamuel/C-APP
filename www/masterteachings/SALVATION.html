        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:20</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">For I tell you, unless your righteousness goes beyond that of the experts in the law and the Pharisees, you will
            never enter the kingdom of heaven!</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:13 - 14</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Enter through the narrow gate, because the gate is wide and the way is spacious that leads to destruction, and there
            are many who enter through it. How narrow is the gate and difficult the way that leads to life, and there are
            few who find it!</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven – only the one who does the will
            of my Father in heaven.</p>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 10:22</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And you will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved!</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 18:3 - 4</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">and said, “I tell you the truth, unless you turn around and become like little children, you will never enter the
            kingdom of heaven! Whoever then humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 18:8 - 9</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled
            or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin,
            tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and
            be thrown into fiery hell.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 19:23 - 26</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
            heaven! Again I say, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter
            into the kingdom of God.” The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said, “Then who can
            be saved?” Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but for God all things are
            possible.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 24:12 - 13</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">and because lawlessness will increase so much, the love of many will grow cold. But the person who endures to the
            end will be saved.
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 13:23 - 26</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, “Strive to enter through the
            narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the master of the house
            has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to
            us,’ then he will answer you, ‘I do not know where you come from.’ Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank
            in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 19:8 - 10</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I
            have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!” Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation
            has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham! For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the
            lost.”
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 3:16 - 17</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him
            will not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world that He might condemn the
            world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</p>



        <h6>
            <i>John 10:7 - 9</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">So Jesus said again, “I assure you: I am the door of the sheep. All who came before me were thieves and robbers,
            but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will
            come in and go out, and find pasture.</p>
