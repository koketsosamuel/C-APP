        </h6>
        <p class="">“When you fast, do not look sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unattractive so that people will
            see them fasting. I tell you the truth, they have their reward! When you fast, anoint your head and wash your
            face, so that it will not be obvious to others when you are fasting, but only to your Father who is in secret.
            And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</p>

        <p class="">“Do not accumulate for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and devouring insect destroy and where thieves break
            in and steal. But accumulate for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and devouring insect do not destroy,
            and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>

        <p class="">“The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your
            eye is diseased, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is
            the darkness! “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be
            devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</p>
