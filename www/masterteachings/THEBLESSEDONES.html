        <p class="">Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. Blessed are those who mourn, for they
            will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
            for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed
            are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the children
            of God.</p>
        <p class="">Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. Blessed are you
            when people insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things about you falsely on account of me.
            Rejoice and be glad because your reward is great in heaven, for they persecuted the prophets before you in the
            same way.</p>
