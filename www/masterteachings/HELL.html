        <h1 class="">HELL</h1>
        <hr>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:22</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever
            says to his brother, Empty head! shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger
            of the fire of Hell.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 5:29 - 30</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away! It is better to lose one of your members than
            to have your whole body thrown into hell. If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away!
            It is better to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:15 - 19</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Watch out for false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are voracious wolves. You will recognize
            them by their fruit. Grapes are not gathered from thorns or figs from thistles, are they? In the same way, every
            good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree is not able to bear bad fruit, nor
            a bad tree to bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 13:41 - 43</i>
        </h6>

        <p class="">The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as
            all lawbreakers. They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
            Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears had better listen!</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 13:47 - 50</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish. When it was
            full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away. It will
            be this way at the end of the age. Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into
            the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 18:8 - 9</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled
            or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin,
            tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and
            be thrown into fiery hell.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 25:41 - 46</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared
            for the devil and his angels! For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me
            nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick
            and in prison and you did not visit me.’ Then they too will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty
            or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not give you whatever you needed?’ Then he will answer them,
            ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for me.’ And
            these will depart into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Mark 9:43 - 48</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than to have two hands
            and go into hell, to the unquenchable fire. If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better to enter
            life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. If your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better
            to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where their worm
            never dies and the fire is never quenched. Everyone will be salted with fire.</p>


        <h6>
            <i>Luke 12:4 - 5</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more they can do.
            But I will warn you whom you should fear: Fear the one who, after the killing, has authority to throw you into
            hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 15:6</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown out like a branch, and dries up; and such branches are gathered up
            and thrown into the fire, and are burned up.</p>
