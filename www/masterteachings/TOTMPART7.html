            <i>Matthew 6:25 - 34</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will
            wear. Isn’t there more to life than food and more to the body than clothing?Look at the birds in the sky: They
            do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.</p>

        <p class="">Aren’t you more valuable than they are? And which of you by worrying can add even one hour to his life? Why do you
            worry about clothing? Think about how the flowers of the field grow; they do not work or spin. Yet I tell you
            that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these!

            <p class="">And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat
                the oven, won’t he clothe you even more, you people of little faith? So then, don’t worry saying, ‘What will
                we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ For the unconverted pursue these things, and your
                heavenly Father knows that you need them.</p>

            <p class="">But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. So then,
                do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.</p>
