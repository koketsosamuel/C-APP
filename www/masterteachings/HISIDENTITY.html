        <h1 class="">WHO HE IS</h1>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 16:13 - 17</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man
            is?" They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." He
            said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living
            God.” And Jesus answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this
            to you, but my Father in heaven!
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 27:41 - 43</i>
        </h6>
        <p class=""> In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law and elders – were mocking him: “He
            saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel! If he comes down now from the cross, we will
            believe in him! He trusts in God – let God, if he wants to, deliver him now because
            <b>he said, ‘I am God’s Son’!”</b>
        </p>




        <h6>
            <i>Luke 6:5</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 10:11</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 14:6</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Jesus replied, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>John 15:1 - 2</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“I am the true vine and my Father is the gardener. He takes away every branch that does not bear fruit in me. He
            prunes every branch that bears fruit so that it will bear more fruit. You are clean already because of the word
            that I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself,
            unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.</p>
