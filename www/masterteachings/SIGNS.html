        <h1 class="">SIGNS OF HIS SECOND COMING</h1>
        <hr>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 24:1 - 30</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts and walking away, his disciples came to show him the temple buildings.
            And he said to them, “Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left on another.
            All will be torn down!” As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said,
            “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</p>

        <p class="">Jesus answered them, “Watch out that no one misleads you. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’
            and they will mislead many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Make sure that you are not alarmed, for
            this must happen, but the end is still to come. For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against
            kingdom. And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</p>

        <p class="">All these things are the beginning of birth pains. “Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you.
            You will be hated by all the nations because of my name. Then many will be led into sin, and they will betray
            one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will appear and deceive many,2 and because lawlessness
            will increase so much, the love of many will grow cold.</p>

        <p class="">But the person who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the
            whole inhabited earth as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. “So when you see the abomination
            of desolation – spoken about by Daniel the prophet – standing in the holy place” (let the reader understand),
            “then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.</p>

        <p class="">The one on the roof must not come down to take anything out of his house, and the one in the field must not turn
            back to get his cloak. Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!
            Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great suffering unlike anything
            that has happened from the beginning of the world until now, or ever will happen.</p>

        <p class="">And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be
            cut short. Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe him. For
            false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even
            the elect.</p>

        <p class="">Remember, I have told you ahead of time. So then, if someone says to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not
            go out, or ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe him. For just like the lightning comes from the east
            and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures
            will gather. “Immediately after the suffering of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not
            give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.</p>

        <p class=""> Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see
            the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</p>
