            <i>Matthew 6:1 - 15</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Be careful not to display your righteousness merely to be seen by people. Otherwise you have no reward with your
            Father in heaven. Thus whenever you do charitable giving, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites
            do in synagogues and on streets so that people will praise them.</p>

        <p class="">I tell you the truth, they have their reward! But when you do your giving, do not let your left hand know what your
            right hand is doing, so that your gift may be in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</p>

        <p class="">“Whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray while standing in synagogues and on
            street corners so that people can see them. Truly I say to you, they have their reward! But whenever you pray,
            go into your inner room, close the door, and pray to your Father in secret. And your Father, who sees in secret,
            will reward you. When you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the Gentiles, because they think that by their
            many words they will be heard.


            <p class="">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So pray this way: Our Father in
                heaven, may your name be honored, may your kingdom come, may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
                Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we ourselves have forgiven our debtors. And do
                not lead us into hard testing, but deliver us from the evil one.</p>


            <p class="">“For if you forgive others their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive
                others, your Father will not forgive you your sins.</p>
