        <h1 class="">DURING HIS SECOND COMING</h1>
        <hr>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 7:21 - 23</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven – only the one who does the will
            of my Father in heaven. On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and cast
            out demons in your name, and do many powerful deeds in your name?’ Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew
            you. Go away from me, you lawbreakers!’</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 25:31 - 46</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. All
            the nations will be assembled before him, and he will separate people one from another like a shepherd separates
            the sheep from the goats.He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.</p>

        <p class="">Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
            for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me
            something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick
            and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’</p>

        <p class="">Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something
            to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you sick
            or in prison and visit you?’ And the king will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did it for one
            of the least of these brothers or sisters of mine, you did it for me.’</p>

        <p class="">“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared
            for the devil and his angels! For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me
            nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you did not receive me as a guest, naked and you did not clothe me, sick
            and in prison and you did not visit me.’</p>


        <p class="">Then they too will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison,
            and did not give you whatever you needed?’ Then he will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did not
            do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for me.’ And these will depart into eternal punishment,
            but the righteous into eternal life.”</p>
