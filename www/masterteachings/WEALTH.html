            <i>Matthew 6:19 - 21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth, where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather, and where thieves
            may come in by force and take it away. But make a store for yourselves in heaven, where it will not be turned
            to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away: For where your wealth is, there will your heart be.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 6:24</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one
            and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</p>


        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 19:20 - 21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">The young man said to him, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws. What do I still lack?” Jesus said to him,
            “If you wish to be perfect, go sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure
            in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
        </p>

        <h6>
            <i>Matthew 19:23 - 26</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">Then Jesus said to his disciples, “I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of
            heaven! Again I say, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter
            into the kingdom of God.” The disciples were greatly astonished when they heard this and said, “Then who can
            be saved?” Jesus looked at them and replied, “This is impossible for mere humans, but for God all things are
            possible.”

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 6:24</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your comfort already.</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 12:16 - 21</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">And he told them a parable, saying, “The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What
            shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and
            build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have
            ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.”’ But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your
            soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?’ So is the one who lays up treasure
            for himself and is not rich toward God.”</p>

        <h6>
            <i>Luke 16:11</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">If then you haven’t been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will entrust you with the true riches?</p>


        <h6>
            <i>Luke 16:19 - 31</i>
        </h6>
        <p class="">“There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day.0 But at his gate
            lay a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores, who longed to eat what fell from the rich man’s
            table. In addition, the dogs came and licked his sores. “Now the poor man died and was carried by the angels
            to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. And in Hades, as he was in torment, he looked up and
            saw Abraham far off with Lazarus at his side. So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus
            to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this fire.’ But Abraham
            said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things and Lazarus likewise bad things, but
            now he is comforted here and you are in anguish. Besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us, so
            that those who want to cross over from here to you cannot do so, and no one can cross from there to us.’ So the
            rich man said, ‘Then I beg you, father – send Lazarus to my father’s house (for I have five brothers) to warn
            them so that they don’t come into this place of torment.’ But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets;
            they must respond to them.’ Then the rich man said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to
            them, they will repent.’ He replied to him, ‘If they do not respond to Moses and the prophets, they will not
            be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”</p>
